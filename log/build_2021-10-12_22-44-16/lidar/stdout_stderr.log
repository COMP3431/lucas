CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findvisualizations_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "visualizations_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "visualizations_msgs" with any of the following names:

    visualizations_msgsConfig.cmake
    visualizations_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "visualizations_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "visualizations_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "visualizations_msgs" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
